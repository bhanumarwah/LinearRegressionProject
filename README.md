# Linear Regression Project

It is a simple Linear Regression Model of the dataset of just two variables
1. No. of Hours 
2. Percentage Scored

I need to predict the percentage scored by a student who studies for 9.5 hours a day. 

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. Loading the dataset using Pandas library of Python.
2. Checking whether the relationship of both the variables is linear or not using Matplotlib library of Python.
3. Segregating the variables into Dependent and Independent variables.
4. Splitting the dataset into test and train sets.
5. Training the model and plotting the Regression line.
6. Making predictions on the test set and comparing the predictions with the actual values.
7. Evaluating the model using mean_absolute_error as the evaluation metric.
